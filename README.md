# physics_expr_genalg_toy

Vibe-coded physics toy which runs a genetic algorithm on symbolic expressions.

- Do I know how the math works? No (I failed algebra).
- Am I confident this is interesting? No.
- Is it a fun distraction? Yes.
- Does it appear to accidentally stumble upon known identities? Also yes.

A couple notes on fun outcomes:

- Once converged to 1/Î› (inverse of cosmological constant)
  - Why? I haven't checked.
- Also once converged on N_A*k_B/R (identity of ideal gas constant)
- m_p/m_n (ratio of the mass of a proton to the mass of a neutron)
